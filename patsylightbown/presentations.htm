            <h3>Lectures and Conference Presentations</h3>
<p>The list below is a sample of the types of lectures and presentations delivered at conferences and professional development events over recent years.</p>
<p><em>Below this, there is another list, showing specific presentations that have been given to different audiences over the past twenty years</em>.</p>
<p>1. <strong>First, second, and bilingual language acquisition from birth to adolescence</strong>.<br />
Myths about the ease with which children acquire languages are examined in light of research in homes and schools. Implications for school-based programs are drawn.<br />
Target audience: In-service and pre-service teachers in K-12 schools, both ESL and mainstream. Also appropriate for teachers of English as a foreign language in non-English-speaking countries.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Transfer-appropriate processing: Research on memory and the transferability of learning as a framework for classroom second language instruction.</strong><br />
Cognitive psychology has provided evidence that the context and processes that are present during learning influence the ability to retrieve and use information. Applications to second language teaching are explored.<br />
Target audience: Researchers and graduate students in applied linguistics.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Time and timing in second language teaching</strong>.<br />
The biggest challenge faced by most second and foreign language teachers is the limited time available for learning. Based on research findings, suggestions are made for making the best use of limited classroom time.<br />
Target Audience: In-service and pre-service teachers in second and foreign language classes. Also appropriate for policy-makers and administrators in school programs.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Putting form-focused instruction in its place</strong>.<br />
Should form-focused instruction be isolated from meaning-focused activities in content-based and communicative second language teaching? Or should it be integrated into those activities? Research and experience suggest a &#8220;place&#8221; for both approaches.<br />
Target audience: Teachers and program developers for second and foreign language teaching at all levels.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Weaving the strands. What are the components of an effective foreign language course?</strong><br />
Students and teachers agree that learners need both instruction that is focused on the formal features of language (grammar, pronunciation, vocabulary, etc.) and opportunities for language use that emphasizes meaningful interaction, but what is the right balance? In this workshop, the four strands for a language course that have been proposed by Paul Nation will be the starting point for examining how different types of activities contribute to foreign and second language learning both in and out of the classroom.<br />
Target audience: Teachers and program developers for second and foreign language teaching at all levels.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Bridging the gap</strong>.<br />
Researchers and teachers have much to learn from each other, but it is not always easy for them to communicate successfully with each other. This presentation reviews some of the reasons for the lack of communication and suggests some remedies.<br />
Target audience: Teachers, teacher educators, and textbook writers for second- and foreign-language programs.</p>
